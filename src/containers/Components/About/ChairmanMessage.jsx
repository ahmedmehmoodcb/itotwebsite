        Children are natural learners. It’s a real achievement to put that
        particular ability out, or to stifle it. Curiosity is the engine of
        achievement. Because the current culture here has been to
        de-professionalize teachers. There is no system in the world or any
        school in the country that is better than its teachers. Teachers are the
        lifeblood of the success of the schools. Teaching is not delivery
        system, it’s a creative profession. They are not there just pass on
        received information. Great teachers do that, but they also stimulate,
        provoke and engage. ITOT trained teacher to facilitate learning. Our
        methodologies and technologies of teaching light the spark of curiosity
        in a child, therefore they learn without any further assistance. We
        train our teacher and children, how to encourage to excite that power of
        the imagination and curiosity rather than to follow routine algorithms.
        There’s a big difference between going into a mode of command and
        control in education, that’s what happens in some systems. Central or
        state governments decide, they are going to tell you what to do? The
        trouble is that education doesn’t go on in the committee rooms of our
        legislative buildings. It happens in classrooms and schools, and the
        people who do it are the teachers and the students, and if you remove
        their direction, it stops working. That’s why we designed this
        methodology and applied it in five schools for 8 years to check all the
        consequences. By continuous changes, we made a unique and the best
        methodologies with latest affordable learning technologies that will
        enhance the standards of education in Pakistan, InShaAllah.
