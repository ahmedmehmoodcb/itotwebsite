      "In 1980, a visionary educationist with over 40 years teaching experience, Sir Hafeez-ur-Rahman, founder of ITOT considering his past teaching experiences, thought of an education system in which children would not be bored. According to that period, he taught and experimented with the help of charts and diagrams. It was concluded that with the help of charts and diagrams the children learn more in a short time and these diagrams and sketches focus the attention of the children which does not feel the burden of reading. In addition to teaching in the form of a story and with activities, he made it clear that these are the requirements that must be met in the upcoming education system.",
